## Adding New Problems

When implementing a new LeetCode problem:

1. [Create a new Issue](https://github.com/minamizawa-git/leetcode-typescript/issues/new?template=new-problem.yml)
2. Write tests (TDD)
3. Implement and refactor

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#project-structure) for implementation conventions and best practices
